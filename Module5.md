# Module 5: Push the docker container to Amazon ECR 

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. 

## Instructions
1. Go to the [ECR Console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/repositories) (You can reach there also by looking for "ECS" or "container service" in the list of services from the console home page and go to ECR **Repositories** 
	
1. Click on **Create repository**

1. Give a name, such as `<your-username>-monte-carlo-simulator` to your repo, then click **Next Step**

1. In the following screen, you will be presented many useful commands. Start with the login command, copy and paste into the Cloud9 terminal:

1. Now you are logged in, use the provided commands to 
	
	* tag your image to prepare it to be pushed 
		
		**note: change the default command from the console to match the image tag** `monte-carlo-simulator:latest` **you built in previous steps**. e.g. 
		
		```
		docker tag monte-carlo-simulator:latest <account-number>.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/<your-username>-monte-carlo-simulator
		```
	 
	
	* push the image to ECR
